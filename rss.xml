            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Camera2 API</h1><p>I started developing in android years ago. Up until now I have stayed away from it because it can frankly be a mess and when fragments got into the picture it was my bane. However I struggled and managed to learn the mysteries of fragments during a school hackathon. Fragments are pretty cool now. I hoping that will be the case with this.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bcd43dbd-d904-499d-acd3-075993457640.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Atmo Sfera Platterless Turntable Spins Vinyl in the Air</h1><p>Chicago's Gramovox already defied gravity with their vertical Floating Record Player, and now Italian start-up Audio Deva offers their own "upside-down" take on a turntable. It eschews the basic design that has "remained the same for about a century."</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4e0e9422dc8b38aa4896d911f5d202f6/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=1162&cropwidth=1503&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F9fb337561fce986fe123f7a74eb6e8ea6a39834a.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Chocolate Skateboards + DQM + Mast Brothers</h1><p>Since its humble beginnings as a sister company to Mike Carroll and Rick Howard's Girl Skateboards, Chocolate has grown into one of the more influential brands in skateboarding's surrounding culture. Now 20 years later, with legends like Gino Iannucci and young gun Elijah Berle on the roster, the company shows no signs of slowing.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/09adb57c67d7d90ccdac72399f593aaf7970d3c7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google May Have Found a Way to Make the Real-World Web Work</h1><p>Remember beacons? Honestly, there's not much reason you would. Hailed for years by Apple, Google, and beyond as one of the next big things in tech-for marketers, at least-the glorious beacon future has yet to arrive in the present. They may get a little closer, however, now that Google has solved one of their major issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60f00415e118224ecabc9f288eafe337a9d94455.jpg"></article>]]></description>
