            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Camera2 API</h1><p>I started developing in android years ago. Up until now I have stayed away from it because it can frankly be a mess and when fragments got into the picture it was my bane. However I struggled and managed to learn the mysteries of fragments during a school hackathon. Fragments are pretty cool now. I hoping that will be the case with this.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bcd43dbd-d904-499d-acd3-075993457640.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

After months-nearly five of them in fact-of waiting, Marvel's one-shot comic, revealing just why C-3PO has a red arm for most of The Force Awakens, is finally here. As bizarre as it may sound at first, the final product isn't half bad.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ff7a99fdf22b973fd7d5ffe88bda91f4fec8e32d.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Techies Project by Photographer Helena Price</h1><p>The two words "Silicon Valley" immediately stir up stereotypes, stigma and maybe an HBO show. The name has become a cultural reflex, and that's what photographer Helena Price wants to change with her ambitious, large-scale portrait and interview series. Techies Project, launched today, is a collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness" plaguing the area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7265c5abd944ed7ad3fdd9c9b6270021b13537b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

They may get a little closer, however, now that Google has solved one of their major issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60f00415e118224ecabc9f288eafe337a9d94455.jpg"></article>]]></description>
