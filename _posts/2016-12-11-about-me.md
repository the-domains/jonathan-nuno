# About Me

A little of everything about me

---

### Who I Was

<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-location/?latitude=33.1959&amp;longitude=-117.3795&amp;zoom=10&amp;address=Oceanside%2C%20California%2C%20United%20States" style=""></iframe>

I went to Mira Costa College in Oceanside, CA from 2009-2013\. I spent a lot of time there while I worked multiple jobs to pay for classes myself. During that time my friends began calling me Juno and I started introducing myself as such. On-line I am junomars or herares. Juno Mars from the similarity to Bruno Mars and herares is meta; Juno is the Roman Hera and Mars is the Roman Ares. I did a lot of random things like being the president of the French club and performing written poetry (slam-poetry style). I also listened to A LOT of motivational speakers and watch endless videos. 

The important part here is I learned how to self-assess. There's more to say there and I would love to get into a conversation with anyone about it.

### Who I Am

I'm a dungeon master in Dungeons & Dragons. I'm in the top 2% among North American ranked players in League of Legends. I'm a programmer with an affinity for algorithms and mathematics. I'm a student majoring in computer science and minoring in applied mathematics. I have a 3.48 GPA, contestant in the regional contest for the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, Officer for the CSULB's ACM club, Senator for the International Housing dormitories at CSULB.

The lesson I learned here is to always try to learn more. I try to get to a level of skill where I can to surround myself with people who know more than me and will get me to where I need to be.

### Who I Want To Be

I want to pursue a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence or Mathematics. I want to apply that in a company to advance their current level of technology as well as create work that will increase the amount of information available to analyze.

I want to give back what I learned. I got a chance to do that at Mira Costa College as a tutor for the C.S. department and I really enjoyed helping others and seeing my peers marvel at what they can do. 

I want to make programs that are derivative but that I feel I can improve upon. I also have some creative ideas in the back burner that will show up between class sessions :D
