# Camera2 API

I started developing in android years ago. Up until now I have stayed away from it because it can frankly be a mess and when fragments got into the picture it was my bane. However I struggled and managed to learn the mysteries of fragments during a school hackathon. Fragments are pretty cool now. I hoping that will be the case with this.

Now to start, I definitely am not an experienced android developer. I am sure there are many supplements I can read to help facilitate my transition from a purely console java environment to android. After all, it worked before when I took the class in 2010\. Or so.

About three weeks ago I got word from a start up who wanted an android developer. I know one of the guys in it and so he vouched for me. The code was given to me and the instructions were, "we want the following features...can you do it?"   
"Well, uh, ahem, I suppose I can?" I mean how hard can it be, really. Apparently, it can be awesomely difficult.

The code I was given had been using the camera API. This is fine and dandy however the my IDE (bless JetBrains) stated the camera library has been deprecated and to instead use camera2\. What it did not say was that camera2 is for API21+ meaning you would technically have to create two code blocks if you want to support older phones. I say technically because the code for API20- works for API21+. So why work more? Well the new camera2 API allows better control of the camera. This would be incredibly useful in the future because - and this might just be my opinion - an application needs to set itself apart from already built applications. The idea should be that the app streamlines whatever work or task you were trying to accomplish. If it does not do that, why use it?

"Juno, why are you complaining then?" I'm not complaining. "It sounds like you're complaining."

The issue is the camera2 api is not so very well documented. The [camera2 api package summary][0] is exactly what it says it is: a summary. I was hoping for more but can't say I'm disappointed there. Java doc is exactly the same way for the most part. So next best course of action is to take a look at the examples. The [camera2video sample project][1] is splendid! Almost. Its README is nice and straightforward. I love when introductions tell you exactly what you are to expect. The code was exactly what it said it would be. The program even ran on the first build! But when I attempted to use it, it threw an error. One could argue this is how an easy way to develop trust issues. I'm not complaining and I'm not discouraged. I'm annoyed.

So, I called forth my Google Fu and unfortunately all the results and attempts at repair seemed to fall short. But I may have found the solution. Stay tuned for an edit.
